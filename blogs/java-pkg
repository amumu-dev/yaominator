This is the notes that I took while reading java tutorial. 

1. package statement must be the first line in the source file.
2. There can be only one package statement in each source file. 
3. only one class/interface can be public, and it must have the same name as the source file. 
4. If you don't use package statement, your type ends up in an unamed package 

To use a public package member from outside its package , you must do one of the following 
1. Refer to the member by its fully qualified name

graphics.Rectangle myrect = new graphics.Rectangle(); 

2. Import the package member

import graphics.Rectangle ;
Rectangle myrect = new Rectangle();

3. Import the member's entire package 

import graphics.*;
Circle myCircle = new Circle();
Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle();

Packages appear to be hierarchical, but they are not.
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.color.*;

If you have two packages have the same member, you need to specify the full name.

when you need to frequent access to static final fields(constants) and static methods from one or two classes. The static import gives you a way to import the constants and static methods that you want to use so that you do not need to prefix the name of their class.
import static java.lang.Math.PI;
import static java.lang.Math.*;

Normally , you can have file structure like this 

source\com\yahoo\tv\Show.java 
source\com\yahoo\tv\Episode.java 

classes\com\yahoo\tv\Show.class
classes\com\yahoo\tv\Episode.class
