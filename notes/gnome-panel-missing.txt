killall gnome-panel

When I logged into the machine today, I was shocked to see no panel appearing on the ubuntu desktop. I thought the computer has hung. But when I right clicked the desktop, I got the regular pop-up menu and was able to change desktop wallpapers.

Here is what I did to get the panel back. With the desktop without the panel and not remembering any of the shortcuts, it was quiet difficult.

First, I created a launcher for Terminal. Right Click on any area on the desktop and then choose ‘Create Launcher’. Choose any name and then in the command text box, type in

terminal
This should create a terminal launcher. That done, double click to open a terminal session. Enter the following command,

killall gnome-panel
Then right click on the desktop to create another launcher. This time in the command text box, type in

gnome-panel
