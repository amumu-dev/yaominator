/*
 * http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/locksync.html
 * Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock.
 * 
 * Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it.
 * 
 * When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the intrinsic lock for that
 * method's object and releases it when the method returns. 
 *
 * In this case, the thread acquires the intrinsic lock for the Class object associated with the class. 
 * Thus access to class's static fields is controlled by a lock that's distinct from the lock for any instance of the class.

 * Atomic Access
 *
 * Reads and writes are atomic for reference variables and for most primitive variables (all types except long and double).
 * Reads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables).
 * 
 * This means that changes to a volatile variable are always visible to other threads. 
 * What's more, it also means that when a thread reads a volatile variable, it sees not just the latest change to the volatile, 
 * but also the side effects of the code that led up the change.

/*
 * A Strategy for Defining Immutable Objects
 * 
 * Don't provide "setter" methods â€” methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
 * Make all fields final and private.
 * Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. 
 * A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
 * 
 * If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
        Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
        Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor; if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
